    <p>Dell, global company that designs, develops, and manufactures personal computers (PCs) and a variety of computer-related products. The company is one of the world’s leading computer brands and suppliers of PCs. Dell is headquartered in Round Rock, Texas.

        The company, first called PC’s Limited, was founded in 1984 by American student Michael Dell, who was attending the University of Texas in Austin at the time. Initially running the business from his dormitory room, Dell started out by providing customized upgrades for PCs. The venture proved to be profitable, and Dell dropped out of college that same year to begin building PCs. 
        In 1985 the company released the Turbo PC, the first computer to feature Dell’s own design. 
        Founded on the premise of creating and selling custom-built PCs directly to consumers, the company initially sold its products through advertisements and mail-order catalogs. By avoiding the costs associated with traditional retail markets, Dell was able to offer high-quality PCs at competitive prices. Dell emphasized customer support, sending technicians to service PCs and implementing a policy of risk-free returns. 
        The business model was successful, and the company quickly grew, expanding into international markets. The company, renamed Dell Computer Corporation, went public in 1988.
